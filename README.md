# AVR-to-Key
This project demonstrates how to use AVR microcontrollers, which do not have native USB keyboard support, to function as a USB HID (Human Interface Device) keyboard. By leveraging the flexibility and power of AVR microcontrollers, you can create custom keyboards and input devices for various applications. Or use physical buttons as inputs for game to experience the realism in your sim hub.
